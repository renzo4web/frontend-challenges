## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned and reinforced knowledge of mobile first layout and also how to make a navbar with javascript also position property of CSS.


### Continued development

I need to improve the integration of CSS and Javascript, definitely something I'm not used to, also the handling with images in responsive designs is something i struggle with.  


### Useful resources
